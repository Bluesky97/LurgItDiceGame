# LurgItDiceGame
This is under university assignment (work-in paired) - two people. This project is to create a Dice Game by using Windows Forms Application (C#). Also, to help for us with better understanding the programming and testing the logical thinking on how we created a functions of the dice game itself. It is really fun to learn by creating a dice game program in c#. Last but not least, I will suggest to run this project from LurgItDiceGameAndrianThet.csproj or can run immediately the project without opening the visual studio (Open the file -> Bin -> Debug -> LurgItDiceGameAndrianThet.exe).
